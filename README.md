# [Professional Villagers](https://modrinth.com/mod/professional-villagers)
A small server-side/singleplayer Minecraft mod for Fabric that makes villagers slightly easier to work with.

(Note: Has only been tested in singleplayer so far!)

### Features:
* Enchantments level up with librarians instead of having a set level.
* Interacting (right-click) with a villager while holding an emerald block resets its trade offers. Only works if the villager doesn't have any experience.
* Interacting with a wandering trader while holding an emerald block dismisses it after 5 seconds. Doesn't dismiss traders spawned by spawn eggs.
* Interacting with a villager while holding a poisonous potato resets its trade offers, level and experience. The villager must have the Weakness effect, same as when curing a zombie villager with a golden apple. The potato is consumed in the process.
* Interacting with a librarian while holding an enchanted book teaches it a random enchantment from said book. Can be done once per master-level librarian. The book is consumed in the process.
* Modifies the trade offers of certain professions:
    * Farmers now always have the pumpkin trade.
    * Fishermen now always have the raw cod trade.
    * Toolsmiths no longer sell axes, but always have the diamond hoe and diamond shovel trades.
* All features are optional.

### Configuration:
Either edit the config file (`professional-villagers.ini`) found in the Fabric config folder (requires a restart for the changes to take effect), or (optionally) use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to edit the options in game.
